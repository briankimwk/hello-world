# hello-world
This project is simply my way of trying out what the Quickstart guide is suggesting
## about-me
I'm just some guy broadening my horizons and putting my overly systematic brain to good use. I ~~am~~ was an international student in Australia, born in South Korea. I live along the east coast and love waffles and yogurt. Here is a picture of one of my family's cats: ![Brian's Cat](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103924211/163794977-bad69d60-b87b-44de-b40f-52d2a17955a6.JPG)
She's **annoying** to say the least.
## computer-science-journey
The road to this foray has been bumpy hitherto. I've struggled with finding a job that has embedded tasks that actually stimulate my brain. Working in healthcare for the past year brought me an invaluable appreciation for empathy, rapport-building and patience with the public. But, every night, I'd come home exhausted and want to dive into something more creative and refreshing for my head. Then, *I found my answer*--let's understand how my amazing creative applications work. I was always a fanboy of products like the Adobe Creative Suite and Logic Pro X for my artsy pastimes. So, this was it. Healthcare and its bachelor's degree had played its parts. It was now time for **computer science**.
## progress-to-date
> “There are only two options: Make progress or make excuses.” 
### javascript
I started with the powerful learning tool of *Codecademy*. Introduction to Javascript tickled my fancy as its frameworks and libraries ike node.js and angular seemed to be in vogue. I learned more about problem-solving and rehashing my math skills than programming itself, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
### roadmap.sh
Here is a cheeky plug to a resource that my girlfriend sent to me: [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh). It's a work-in-progress, but its developers have done a fantastic job in creating a little guideline for beginner programmers. This is where I built foundational knowledge of the following:
- HTTP
- Browsers
- Threads, concurrency and parallelism
- Memory management
### HTML-and-CSS
I completed both of the intro courses to these on *w3schools* and *Codecademy*. To be frank, it was a bit rushed at a more stressful period in the year with lots of patients needing some more urgent attention and external sporting club work taking up time. In short, although I have an understanding of the syntax behind these two, I am far from what one might call *skilled* 😆.
### always-learning
As of 18/04/2022, I've just completed some university-level calculus and linear algebra units and have made a start on the highly-regarded CS50x course on edX Harvard University. That led me to make a start on Git. I'm always learning, so let's just see where this takes me! 😂
